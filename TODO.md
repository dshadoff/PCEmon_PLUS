# TODO (feature requests):

- Add interactive memory edit
- Add ZMODEM transfers for easier data handling
- Add disassembler (and save to SDCard/computer)
- Add more clever management of input control (i.e. PCE can signal back with
extended /CLR=high signal, that PCE is ready for PCEmoninput)
- Memory compare: take a snapshot, and compare later (to spot changes in BRAM for example)

This is prototype software, and as such has been minimally tested.
Use at your own risk.
