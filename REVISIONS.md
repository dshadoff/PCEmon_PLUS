# REVISIONs

20191214:
- Initial check-in of rev. A boards.  Fair power isolation between PC and PCE, but
boot-up of MCU causes garbage input on the PCE side.
- Currently, only a shell pass-thru interface with trivial commands are implemented
(including input-swapping), with more to come once the rev. B boards are received
and verified

This is prototype software, and as such has been minimally tested.
Use at your own risk.
